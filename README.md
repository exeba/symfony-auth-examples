Symfony Auth Demo
========================

This is the "Symfony Demo Application" created via:

```bash
$ symfony new --demo my_project
```

Each branch showcases an example of [SebAuthBundle][1] or [SebSamlBundle][2].
Since the documentation for these projects is still lacking,
the best way to understand how they are used is to compare 
the master branch of this project with the example branches.
